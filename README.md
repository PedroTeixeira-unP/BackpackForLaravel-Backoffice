## Project

This backoffice, a testament to the effective use of the Laravel framework, was developed for a roleplaying server. It significantly enhanced the website's functionality and logic, rendering it more dynamic and user-friendly. 

However, it's important to note that the server and this site are no longer online. 

Additionally, this project serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of Backpack, which requires a paid key for full functionality.
